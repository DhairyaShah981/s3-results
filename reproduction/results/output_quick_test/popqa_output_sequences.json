She has been noted as one of the primary figures in Quebecois silent cinema and was likely one of the first female screenwriters in Quebec. In the early years of Francophone cinema in Canada, films were primarily focused on non-fiction topics; filmmakers produced newsreels, actualities, and travelogues. However, of the few fiction films produced, Emma Gendron was a notable female screenwriter alongside Marguerite Marquis. Gendron also became well-known for her column, \"\"Courrier de Manon\"\", and also ran as candidate in federal elections.\nDoc 8(Title: Alain-Fournier) Alain-Fournier Alain-Fournier () was the pseudonym of Henri-Alban Fournier (3 October 1886 \u2013 22 September 1914), a French author and soldier.

His typical mixtures of media and styles displayed a kind of applied experimentalism in which he reconciled the most ingenious sound research with the greatest evocative immediacy; he maintained the same kind of organisational rigour and expressiveness that was to be found in his concert music .

Valentini's oeuvre consists for the most part of different kinds of vocal music: madrigals, masses, motets and sacred concertos. Because he was apparently not interested in writing oratorios or operas, Valentini is sometimes regarded as a conservative composer, especially when compared to Monteverdi. This is, however, somewhat erroneous, as numerous works exhibit considerable innovations and elaborate experimentation.

Traversi's satirical paintings typically depict animated groups of bourgeois protagonists that seem compressed physically into an indoor pictorial space that can barely contain them. Even his religious canvases have foreshortened crowding. Facial expressions are lively and varied; some of the characters, often children, stare at the viewer.
